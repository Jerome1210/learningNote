# **My Coding Path**
## Learning Note

### 01Feb.2023- Hello World :tada:
Today is my first time to push the file successfully to Github.

After several hours for researching.
Created ssh-key, checked the environment, saw __OhMyZsh__ been updated with pic

which is inspiring for me to keep going.

I edit code in Atom, type command line in terminal, learn how to use MARKDOWN to edit README.
Try different git config to push updated file to Github finally.
